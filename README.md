## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

```sh
  cd my-folder-name
  git clone git@github.com:NitBravoA92/project-to-do-list.git
```

### Prerequisites
In order to install, modify and run this project, it is necessary to have the following applications installed:
- **Git:** to manage the project versions of source code. [You can Download Git here](https://git-scm.com/)
- **Nodejs and NPM:** to install and manage the project dependencies. [Nodejs and NPM installation guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- **A code editor** like Visual Studio Code (Recommended) or any other of your preference. It is necessary to open the project and add or modify the source code. [You can Download Visual Studio Code here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

It is also important to have at least basic knowledge about webpack tool, HTML, CSS and Javascript languages so you will be able to understand and work with the html and css code of the project. 
- [Learn the basics of HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [Learn the basics of CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- [JavaScript basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)
- [Javascript Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
- [Javascript Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)
- [JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
- [Webpack - Getting Started](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/)


### Install

Install this project by running the next command into your project folder:

```sh
  npm install
```

All the packages and libraries necessary for the project to work will be installed in a folder called /node_module

### Usage

Run the following command to start the application on a development server: 

```sh
  npm start
```

You only need to run this command once. If you keep making changes to the files, the installed webpack server will reload the page so you can see the changes immediately.

Open the HTML, CSS or Javascript files and modify the internal code, then run the following command to check if your code has any syntax, indentation or spacing errors:

HTML Linter
```sh
  npm start
```

CSS Linter
```sh
  npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"
```

Javascript Linter
```sh
  npx eslint .
```

This will show you a log with details about errors (if any) and changes that would be necessary to solve those errors and improve the code.

**Note**: Please only modify the HTML, CSS and Javascript files. Do not modify the configuration files of the project.

When all the code changes are ready, run the following command to have webpack generate the bundle files in your ./dist folder. Those files are optimized for use in production.

```sh
  npm run build
```
